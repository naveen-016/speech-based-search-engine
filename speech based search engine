🎙️ Speech-Based Search Engine

This Python script enables users to perform Google searches using their voice. It utilizes speech recognition to capture voice input and text-to-speech to interact with the user, making hands-free web searches easy and accessible.

## 📌 Features

* Captures voice commands using your microphone
* Converts speech to text using Google's Speech Recognition API
* Opens a Google search for the recognized query in the default web browser
* Provides audible feedback using text-to-speech

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The script uses `speech_recognition` to listen to your voice.
2. It converts the spoken query into text.
3. It then launches a browser window with the corresponding Google search.
4. Audible prompts and responses are provided using `pyttsx3`.

## 🧰 Dependencies

Install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
```

Note: `pyaudio` may require system-level dependencies (e.g., `portaudio`).

## 📝 Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python speech\ based\ search\ engine.py
```

Speak clearly into your microphone when prompted with “What do you want to search for?”

## 🖥️ Example Output

```
Listening...
Recognizing...
You said: weather today
```

→ Your browser opens a tab with Google search results for "weather today".

## 🔒 Notes

* An active internet connection is required for speech recognition.
* Ensure your microphone is enabled and accessible.
